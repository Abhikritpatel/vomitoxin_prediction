# Vomitoxin Prediction Using Hyperspectral imaging data
This repository contains a machine learning model for predicting vomitoxin levels using deep learning.

## 📌 Project Overview  
Vomitoxin (Deoxynivalenol) is a mycotoxin that affects grain crops. This project leverages a trained deep learning model (`best_vomitoxin_model.h5`) to predict vomitoxin levels from input data.

## 🚀 Features  
- Deep learning-based vomitoxin prediction  
- Model trained using TensorFlow/Keras    
- Dataset preprocessing and feature extraction included  

## 📁 Repository Structure

## 🔧 Installation  
Clone the repository and install dependencies:  
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Abhikritpatel/vomitoxin_prediction.git  
cd vomitoxin_prediction  
pip install -r requirements.txt  

You can load the trained model and use it to make predictions with new input data:

import tensorflow as tf

# Load the trained model
model = tf.keras.models.load_model("best_vomitoxin_model.h5")

# Example: Predict using sample input (replace with actual data)
import numpy as np
sample_input = np.array([[feature1, feature2, feature3, ...]])  # Replace with actual input features
prediction = model.predict(sample_input)
print("Predicted Vomitoxin Level:", prediction)

🔬 Model Details
Architecture: Deep Learning (CNN/LSTM/etc.)
Framework: TensorFlow/Keras
Training Data: Hyperspectral imaging data for corn samples at different wavelengths and their corresponding vomitoxin concentration
